The run_analysis.R script executes the steps of course projectâ€™s instructions.

Download dataset and unzip to folder UCI HAR Dataset

Assign each data to variables

Merge  training and the test datasets to create one data set
x dataset merges x_train and x_test using rbind() function
y dataset merges y_train and y_test using rbind() function
subject dataset merges subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
merged dataset merges subject, y and x datasets using cbind() function

Subset the dataset 'merged'- only columns subject and code- measuring mean and standard deviation for each measurement. Call new dataset 'mean_std'

Rename the activities in the dataset per the second column of the 'activities' dataset

Create a second tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject by grouping on activity and subject. save to 'DF_Final'

write 'DF_Final' into a FinalData.txt file.
